# Maze Generator and Solver

A C program that generates a random maze using the recursive backtracking algorithm and solves it using Depth-First Search (DFS). 
The maze is displayed in the console with ASCII characters: # for walls, for paths, and * for the solution path. This project demonstrates
proficiency in C programming, including 2D arrays, recursion, graph algorithms, and modular code design.

# Features

- Generates random mazes of size 11x21 (configurable by editing maze.c).
- Solves the maze from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner.
- Displays the generated maze and the solved maze with the path marked.
- Modular functions for maze generation, solving, and display.
- Error handling for invalid maze configurations.

# Installation

- Clone or download this repository
- ensure maze.c is in your project directory
